CS265 Lab 1 Assignment.

In the CS265_Lab1Test.java class – there are two methods called method1 and method 2.

You are asked to create at least 6 TestNG tests for each method in this class. You do not
need to use equivlance partioning or other methods.

The goal is to “exercise the specification” and to write these software tests to test if the code
works based on the specification you are given.

Make sure you also have tests that FAIL.

In the case of these two methods the specification is the text supplied as comments before each
method.

Try to look at the specification and write your tests which relate directly to what is written in the
specification. Do not be influenced by the code within the methods as in reality in a black box
test scenario this would be hidden from you entirely.

To repeat: You should build your test cases based on the specification of both methods only
– you should not concern yourself with the source code. You should also have tests that fail.

It is advisable that you plan out your test cases ON PAPER first – and then create them as
TestNG tests.

Try to be creative in your tests.

Write your code for each test and be sure to save your file(s) as you are working.

When the tests are executed and ran (see above how to run as TestNG tests) – you should have a
look at the bottom of the Eclipse window – click on the “Results of running … “ tab – this will
allow you to see what information Eclipse and TestNG generate about the tests.
